#The challenge:
you'll build out my social link-sharing profile.

Your users should be able to: 

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

##Ideas to test yourself
1. Personalize the project to add my information, links, and color palette.
2. Focus on writing semantic HTML and using the correct elements based on the content.
3. Ensure visitors can navigate the links only using their keyboard.
4. Train your eye for detail by making your solution look similar to the design.
